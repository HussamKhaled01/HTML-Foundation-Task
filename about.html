            A quiet thought beneath the sky, Where questions drift and answers lie.
                No noise, no rush—just steady light, A mind awake within the night.

            Each doubt refined, each truth made clear, By patient steps that conquer fear.
                     In silent work, the meaning grows—A deeper root than surface shows.
