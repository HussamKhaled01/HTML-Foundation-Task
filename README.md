# HTML-Foundation-Practice-Exercises


This repository contains structured HTML5 practice exercises covering core web development fundamentals.

- Throughout these modules, I implemented and tested:

- Basic HTML5 document structure and content organization

- Text formatting and semantic elements

- Images, links, and metadata configuration

- Audio, video, and embedded external content (YouTube, Google Maps)

- Form creation with validation and different input types

- GET vs POST form behavior

- Block vs inline element behavior

- Semantic layout using modern HTML5 tags

- Accessibility improvements using ARIA and proper heading hierarchy

- Basic SEO concepts such as meta descriptions and structured markup

All exercises were developed and tested using VS Code, Live Server, and browser DevTools.
Accessibility validation was performed using the WAVE extension.
